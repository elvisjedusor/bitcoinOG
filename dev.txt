Deploy and maintain a live, functional blockchain network using Satoshi Nakamoto’s last solo-developed codebase, modified only where required for:

Modern OS compatibility

Network sustainability (difficulty, timing, reward)

Explicitly defined protocol changes (listed below)

Phase 1: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (daemon only)

Phase 2: Ubuntu GUI (wxWidgets)

Phase 3: macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)

Phase 4: Windows 10 (x64)

2.1 Network Identity (Hard Fork by Design)

Change:

pchMessageStart

Default P2P port

Default RPC port

Purpose: absolute network isolation

2.2 Genesis Block (REQUIRED)

Create a new genesis block

Keep structure identical to Bitcoin:

save Coinbase message

Same script structure

Parameters:

Timestamp: same

Nonce: mined to satisfy new difficulty

Must hardcode:

Genesis hash

Merkle root

Files likely affected:

main.cpp

chainparams (inline in v0.3.0 logic)

2.3 Difficulty Rules (MODIFIED)
Initial Difficulty

Set very low starting difficulty to mine on 1 VPS core 1 block per 30-60 sec (e.g. 0x1f00ffff or equivalent)

Retargeting

Change difficulty adjustment interval:

From: 2016 blocks

To: 10 blocks

Target Block Time

From: 10 minutes

To: 1 minute

Retarget Formula

Same formula logic

Only constants change:

nTargetTimespan

nTargetSpacing

Files:

main.cpp

2.4 Block Reward

From: 50 coins

To: 5 coins (÷10)

Halving logic:

Keep same structure

Decide:

scale proportionally (recommended: 2,100,000 blocks)

Must be explicitly defined and documented.

3. NETWORK BOOTSTRAP (LIVE NETWORK)
3.1 Seed Nodes

No DNS seeds

Hardcode 2–3 VPS nodes:

IP:PORT directly in source

These nodes:

Run 24/7

Serve as permanent bootstrap anchors

Files:

net.cpp

net.h

3.2 Daemon Behavior

Must support:

Mining (-gen)

RPC mining control

Wallet creation

TX relay

Block relay

4. BUILD SYSTEM (UBUNTU FIRST)
4.1 Toolchain

Compiler: gcc >= 11

Standard: C++11 (minimum)

OS: Ubuntu 24.04

4.2 Dependencies

Berkeley DB 4.8 (MANDATORY)

Wallet compatibility depends on this

OpenSSL

Use compatibility wrappers for deprecated APIs

Boost

Minimal version that compiles cleanly

wxWidgets (for GUI later)

4.3 Build Output

bitcoinogd (daemon)

Static linking preferred

5. DAEMON PHASE (PHASE 1)
Deliverables

bitcoinogd

Config file support:

bitcoinog.conf

CLI functionality:

getinfo

getblockcount

sendtoaddress

getbalance

VPS Deployment

Minimum 2 nodes, ideally 3

Public IPs

Firewall open on P2P + RPC (RPC restricted)

6. GUI WALLET (PHASE 2)
Ubuntu GUI

Use original wxWidgets UI

No UI redesign

Only fixes required to compile/run

Must Support:

Create wallet

Show balance

Send / receive

Show transactions

Start/stop mining

7. macOS PORT (PHASE 3)
Targets

macOS 12+

Intel + Apple Silicon

Notes

wxWidgets compatibility fixes

Replace deprecated macOS APIs only where required

Codesigning optional initially

8. WINDOWS 10 PORT (PHASE 4)
Targets

Windows 10 x64

MinGW or MSVC

Requirements

GUI wallet

Installer optional (ZIP acceptable initially)

9. Research


9.1 Time Handling

GetAdjustedTime()

Possible overflow / drift issues

9.2 Mining Thread Stability

CPU mining assumptions from 2010

Thread locking issues on modern CPUs

9.3 Networking

IPv6 handling

Socket initialization

Non-blocking IO assumptions



11. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
Required Files

README.md

Philosophy

Explicit protocol changes

Build instructions

PROTOCOL_CHANGES.md

NETWORK_PARAMS.md

DISCLAIMER.md

12. SUCCESS CRITERIA

The project is considered successful when:

Fresh node can:

Download client

Sync from genesis

Mine blocks

Send and receive coins

Network remains live without manual intervention

Multiple independent nodes can join and stay in consensus

FINAL COMMENT (IMPORTANT)

What you are building is not historical Bitcoin and not modern Bitcoin.

It is a Satoshi-era Bitcoin-derived sovereign network, intentionally modified for survivability, while preserving:

Code style

Architecture

UX

Mental model of early Bitcoin

That positioning is technically and philosophically defensible.
